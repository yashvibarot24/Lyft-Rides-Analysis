This project analyzes Lyft ride data from 2011 to 2024, uncovering insights related to ride patterns, seasonal trends, weather effects, and more. The analysis focuses on understanding factors that influence ridership, such as time of day, weather conditions, and holidays. Using SQL for data extraction, Python for analysis, and Tableau for visualization, this project aims to provide actionable insights into Lyftâ€™s performance and ride demand trends.

## <u><b>SQL Queries Overview</b></u>

The SQL queries used in this project cover several key areas:

- **<u>Data Insertion and Table Creation</u>**: Setting up the database and importing the dataset into the `LyftRidesdata` table.
- **<u>Ride Demand Analysis</u>**: Queries to calculate total ride counts, breakdown by user types (casual vs. registered), and rides by season.
- **<u>Time-Based Insights</u>**: Analyzing peak ride hours, weekly trends, and the effect of holidays and working days.
- **<u>Weather and Temperature Impact</u>**: Assessing how weather conditions and temperature affect ride demand.
- **<u>Top Rides and Correlation</u>**: Identifying the days with the highest ride demand and exploring correlations between temperature and ride counts.

All the SQL queries used for this analysis are stored in the [lyft_queries.sql](./sql/lyft_queries.sql) file.

## <u><b>Tools and Technologies Used</b></u>

- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing the dataset.
- **Excel**: For data visualization.
